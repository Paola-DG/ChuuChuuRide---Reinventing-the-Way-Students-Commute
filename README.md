## 🔎 Problem  
Broken commutes create broken opportunities for students:  
- ❌ **No rides for campus events** → Students miss activities.  
- 🚌 **Bus delays** → Students arrive late to class.  
- 🚗 **Parking shortages** → Campus overcrowding.  
- ⛽ **High gas prices** → Driving is unaffordable.  
- 🌍 **Transportation is unsustainable** → Cars are the #1 source of CO₂ emissions in transport.  

Students currently rely on unreliable carpools via WhatsApp/Discord. There is no **trusted, student-focused platform**.

## 🚧 Roadblocks on the Student Journey  
- ⚠️ **Fake accounts** = Risk to student safety.  
- 📊 **Overwhelming demand** = 85% of U.S. students commute.  
- 🏫 **Large commuter populations** = Hard to manage, few reliable solutions.  

💡 *Every challenge is also an opportunity. ChuuChuuRide turns obstacles into competitive advantages.*
